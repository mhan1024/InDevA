<h1>InDevA (Infor Developer Assistant)</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
The Developer Portal has many contributors writing content. Inconsistency becomes an issue that arises as large amounts of new content are being published and requires constant oversight on a regular basis. InDevA (Infor Developer Assistant) is a small-scale deep learning AI model that takes a written tutorial as an input and generates feedback, such as suggestions for improving tone. This model attempts to mimic the behavior of Grammarly while being trained on InforOSâ€™s contextual information to enhance the accuracy of the output. Although the model is small-scale and currently trained on BIRST, it is designed to be scalable and can process information about all InforOS platforms, if relevant information can be obtained from the Developer Portal.
